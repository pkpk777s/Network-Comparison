# ResNet Implementation for Image Classification

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for a PyTorch implementation of ResNet (Residual Network) for image classification. The implementation includes the complete pipeline from data loading to model training, evaluation, and visualization.

ResNet is a deep convolutional neural network architecture that introduced residual learning to address the degradation problem in deep networks. This implementation supports both ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 variants.

## Architecture

### ResNet Components

1. **BasicBlock**: The fundamental building block of ResNet that implements the residual connection
   - Two 3×3 convolutional layers with batch normalization and ReLU activation
   - Shortcut connection that performs identity mapping or 1×1 convolution when dimensions change

2. **ResNet**: The main network architecture
   - Initial convolutional layer with batch normalization
   - Four layer groups with increasing channel dimensions (64, 128, 256, 512)
   - Average pooling and fully connected layer for classification

3. **Model Variants**:
   - ResNet18: Uses [2,2,2,2] blocks in the four layer groups
   - ResNet34: Uses [3,4,6,3] blocks in the four layer groups

## Execution Pipeline

The implementation follows this execution pipeline:

1. **Setup and Configuration**
   - Set random seeds for reproducibility
   - Configure device (CPU/GPU)
   - Define hyperparameters (epochs, batch size, learning rate)

2. **Data Preparation**
   - Define data transformations for training and testing
     - Random cropping and flipping for training data augmentation
     - Normalization using CIFAR-10 mean and standard deviation
   - Load CIFAR-10 dataset
   - Create data loaders with specified batch size

3. **Model Initialization**
   - Create ResNet18 model instance
   - Move model to appropriate device (CPU/GPU)
   - Initialize loss function (CrossEntropyLoss)
   - Initialize optimizer (Adam)
   - Initialize learning rate scheduler (ReduceLROnPlateau)

4. **Training Loop**
   - For each epoch:
     - Train the model on training data
     - Evaluate on test data
     - Update learning rate based on test loss
     - Save metrics for visualization
     - Save model if performance improves

5. **Evaluation and Visualization**
   - Plot training and testing metrics (loss and accuracy)
   - Visualize model predictions on test images
   - Provide function for inference on single images

## Usage

### Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch 1.0+
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- numpy

### Basic Usage

1. **Run the entire script**:
   ```bash
   python train_resnet.py
   ```

2. **Modify hyperparameters** (optional):
   Edit the hyperparameters section to change:
   - Number of epochs
   - Batch size
   - Learning rate
   - Number of classes (if using a different dataset)

3. **Use a different dataset** (optional):
   Replace the CIFAR-10 dataset loading with your custom dataset.

4. **Use a pre-trained model for inference**:
   ```python
   # Load the model
   model = ResNet18(num_classes=10)
   model.load_state_dict(torch.load('models/resnet_best.pth'))
   model.to(device)
   model.eval()
   
   # Make prediction
   prediction = predict_single_image('path_to_your_image.jpg')
   print(f'Predicted class: {prediction}')
   ```

### Customization Options

1. **Change model architecture**:
   ```python
   # Use ResNet34 instead of ResNet18
   model = ResNet34(num_classes=10).to(device)
   ```

2. **Modify data augmentation**:
   ```python
   # Add more data augmentation techniques
   transform_train = transforms.Compose([
       transforms.RandomCrop(32, padding=4),
       transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
       transforms.RandomRotation(15),  # Add rotation
       transforms.ColorJitter(brightness=0.2),  # Add color jitter
       transforms.ToTensor(),
       transforms.Normalize((0.4914, 0.4822, 0.4465), (0.2023, 0.1994, 0.2010)),
   ])
   ```

3. **Change optimizer or learning rate scheduler**:
   ```python
   # Use SGD with momentum instead of Adam
   optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate, momentum=0.9, weight_decay=5e-4)
   
   # Use step learning rate scheduler
   scheduler = optim.lr_scheduler.StepLR(optimizer, step_size=30, gamma=0.1)
   ```

## Key Functions

### Training and Evaluation

- `train(epoch)`: Trains the model for one epoch and returns training loss and accuracy
- `test(epoch)`: Evaluates the model on test data and returns test loss and accuracy

### Visualization

- `visualize_predictions()`: Displays model predictions on a batch of test images
- `predict_single_image(image_path)`: Performs inference on a single image

## Best Practices

This implementation follows several software engineering best practices:

1. **Code Organization**:
   - Modular design with clear separation of model architecture, data loading, and training logic
   - Well-defined functions with specific responsibilities

2. **Reproducibility**:
   - Fixed random seeds for reproducible results
   - Consistent data preprocessing

3. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Regular progress updates during training
   - Comprehensive metrics tracking
   - Visualization of training progress

4. **Model Persistence**:
   - Saving the best model based on validation performance
   - Directory creation for model storage

5. **Resource Management**:
   - Automatic device selection (CPU/GPU)
   - Batch processing for memory efficiency

6. **Error Handling and Debugging**:
   - Clear print statements for monitoring training progress
   - Visualization tools for debugging model predictions

## Performance Considerations

- **Batch Size**: Adjust based on available GPU memory
- **Learning Rate**: The implementation uses a learning rate scheduler to automatically adjust the learning rate
- **Data Augmentation**: Helps prevent overfitting, especially with limited data
- **Early Stopping**: Implemented indirectly by saving the best model

## Extending the Implementation

To extend this implementation for other tasks:

1. **Different Datasets**:
   - Modify the data loading section
   - Adjust input channels and image size if necessary
   - Update normalization statistics

2. **Transfer Learning**:
   - Load pre-trained weights
   - Freeze early layers
   - Replace the final classification layer

3. **Different Tasks**:
   - For object detection: Add region proposal network
   - For segmentation: Replace final layers with upsampling path

## Conclusion

This ResNet implementation provides a solid foundation for image classification tasks. It includes all necessary components for training, evaluation, and inference, following best practices in deep learning and software engineering.

The modular design allows for easy customization and extension to different datasets and tasks, making it a versatile tool for various computer vision applications.
